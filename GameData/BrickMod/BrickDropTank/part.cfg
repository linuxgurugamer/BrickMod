    description = When the CEO of AtomicTech Inc. noticed that the company was running out of lunch money, he immediately called up his friends at SpaceTux Industries to see if they had a contract or two they could float his way. They had a particularly odd contract, a dropable version of the K3-G00M Fuel Tank. The CEO quickly got his engineering teams into action, creating the K3-G00DM Fuel Tank for all your disposable fuel needs.
