    description = Upon the creation of the third batch of the 2x3 plates, a lunch break was taken too early by one of the production line engineers. This unnamed Kerbal, named Adam, accidentally spilt some mustard on the control panel and frantically tried to wipe it off. In his mad dash to clean the console, he accidentally inputed commands to restart the production line with a new product in mind. This mangled heap would later be refined into the AT-TREL "Gigachad" Large Toroidal Gas Core Thermonuclear Rocket Engine. Adam Kervage would never be heard or seen again, the only evidence that they ever found of him was a prototype for the EE-ZE Connect 4x6 Structural Plate.
