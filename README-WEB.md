iA long time ago, in a galaxy far, far, zxfdasfsdfasdfa

Many years ago, forum user @keptin felt something in the universe which made him create this abnormal mod,  The original thread used to be here, you can probably find it in the Wayback machine: https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/2503-v0-6-BrickMod?p=184729&viewfull=1#post184729

Then, in 2013, forum user @Robotorevived it for a while, thread is here: https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/46243-updated-brickmod-to-work-with-new-ksp/

It then fell into the abyss of darkness, until recently.    Back in 2017 I got a copy sent to me, but never did anything.  Until today.

This is a revival of this mod, updated (somewhat) for KSP 1.12.  I haven't done anything yet beyond fixing the absolute minimum to make it load in 1.12, this means that the categories may not be optimal, the costs most definitely are not, and the tech levels are not set at all; all parts are currently available at the start.

I do intend to get that updated over time, help would be appreciated.

All that being said, I now present the revival of:
